# Password-Manager
The Password Manager is a React-based application designed to securely manage and store user passwords using local storage. This application provides a user-friendly interface that allows individuals to easily add, view, edit, and delete their saved passwords.

Key Features:
User Interface: The application features an intuitive interface with forms for entering website URLs, usernames, and passwords. Users can toggle the visibility of their passwords and easily manage their entries with clear buttons for saving, editing, and deleting.

Local Storage Integration: Instead of relying on a server or database, this password manager uses the browser’s local storage to securely store user data. This approach ensures that all password information remains on the user's device, enhancing privacy and reducing the need for backend infrastructure.

Password Management: Users can save new passwords with unique IDs, which are generated automatically. The application allows users to view their stored passwords in a table format, making it easy to keep track of different entries. Each password entry can be edited or deleted as needed.

Copy to Clipboard: For convenience, the application includes functionality to copy passwords, usernames, or URLs to the clipboard with a single click. This feature simplifies the process of using stored credentials for logging into various sites.

Error Handling and Notifications: The application provides feedback through notifications and alerts for successful actions or any issues encountered during interactions, such as saving or deleting passwords.

Security Considerations: Although the application uses local storage for convenience, it’s crucial to be aware of the inherent security risks. Local storage is accessible by JavaScript running on the same origin, which means that while data is not sent over the internet, it’s still important to ensure the application is used in a secure environment.

By leveraging React’s state management and local storage capabilities, the Password Manager delivers a practical and accessible solution for handling personal passwords without the complexity of server-side management.
